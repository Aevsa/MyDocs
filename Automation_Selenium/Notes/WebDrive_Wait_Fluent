The Selenium WebDriverWait class, which extends the FluentWait class,
contains timer methods that allow waiting for a specific condition
until it is found.
It includes such methods as waiting until a condition is met,
polling intervals, ignoring specific exceptions while polling, and so on.

To summarize, any of the ExpectedCondition class methods can be wrapped in synchronization methods as
in these examples to wait for element conditions like clickable, text, titles, URLs, and so on.
It is important to keep in mind that these methods will only wait up to the designated time period at the most,
but as soon as it finds the element, it moves on.
This is unlike the behavior of a hardcoded sleep,
which will wait the entire length of time passed into it.
