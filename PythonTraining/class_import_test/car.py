# Advice from Python Experts and Books
# As you can see, Python gives you many options for how to structure code in a large project.
# It’s important to know all these possibilities so you can determine the best ways to organize your
# projects as well as understand other people’s projects.
# When you’re starting out, keep your code structure simple.
# Try doing everything in one file and moving your classes to separate modules once everything is working.
# If you like how modules and files interact, try storing your classes in modules when you start a project.
# Find an approach that lets you write code that works, and go from there.
