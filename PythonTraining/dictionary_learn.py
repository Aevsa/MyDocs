#A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs.
# Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a
# key to access the value associated with that key.
# Dictionary is wrapped in curly braces

# A keyâ€™s value can be a number,
# a string, a list, or even another dictionary.
# In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python
# as a value in a dictionary.

color_shirt = {'color': 'green'}
# Color is the Key
# Green is the Value
# Key-Value Pair
# Dictionaries  are called Dynamic Structures. They are good for fast lookups
# Lists and Tuples are best for ordered sequences
# A dictionary is useful when you need to associate keys (unique identifiers)
# with values (data)
