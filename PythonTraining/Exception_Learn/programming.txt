In C++ terminology, normally class members
(including the data members) are public
(except see below Private Variables), and
all member functions are virtual.
As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for
referencing the objectâ€™s members from its methods:
the method function is declared with an explicit
first argument representing the object,
which is provided implicitly by the call.
 As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects.
 This provides semantics for importing and renaming.
 Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used
 as base classes for extension by the user.
 Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax
 (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.)
 can be redefined for class instances.
